Daily Progress Report – Graphs & Python Core Review

Topics Covered:

1. Graph Representations & Operations
- Studied Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List representation of graphs.
- Practiced the following operations:
  - Adding edges
  - Removing edges
  - Printing the graph

2. Graph Traversals
- Understood and implemented:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS) – Explores neighbors level-by-level.
  - Depth-First Search (DFS) – Explores as deep as possible before backtracking.
- Applied both traversals on:
  - Adjacency Matrix
  - Adjacency List

3. Key Concepts Revised
- Difference between BFS and DFS
- Traversal types: Pre-order, In-order, Post-order (for trees)
- Difference between Dijkstra's Algorithm and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in terms of:
  - Node coverage
  - Edge weight criteria

4. Python Core Concepts Revised
